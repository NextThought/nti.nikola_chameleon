0.0.1a2 (unreleased)
====================

- Map the Nikola ``messages`` function onto the native ``i18n``
  functionality of Chamleon. Attributes like ``i18n:translate`` are
  now preferred to explicit calls to ``options/messages`` when
  possible.


0.0.1a1 (2017-10-09)
====================

- Preliminary PyPI release. While this package is functional, it is
  not yet documented sufficiently to be of general use. It is also not
  expected to be fully stable.
